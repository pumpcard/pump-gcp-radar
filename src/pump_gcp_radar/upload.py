"""
Push pump-gcp-radar CSV output to Pump's self-serve onboarding endpoint.

A Pump user mints a short-lived upload token in the app; the customer pastes it
into

    pump-gcp-radar ... --upload-token <TOKEN>

and this module, after the inventory and billing CSVs are written, exchanges the
token for a presigned S3 PUT URL (one per file) and uploads each CSV directly to
Pump's bucket. The token carries no company id — the backend pins the company and
derives the S3 key server-side, so the token can only ever write its own upload's
prefix.

No AWS credentials of Pump's are involved on the client: the presigned URL already
carries everything the PUT needs. Only the two CSVs leave the customer's machine.
